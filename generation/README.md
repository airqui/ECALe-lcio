Please read both READMEs from both detectors.

# GEOMETRY
All the geometry decription.
Adapted from SiWECAL-TB202206 to ECALe_LUXE (npod)

# RUN_SCRIPTS
Everything needed to run the simulation by using the geometries.
	   `generic_condor.sh` is the template file that runs each particle run.
	   `send_grid.sh` is the launch file.
	   `restart_everything.sh` does what its name says, be careful with it.
